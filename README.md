### SDG : Good Health & Well-being
Mobile Application |  3rd year 2nd semester UEE Project | SLIIT 

<h2>About this project</h2>
“Good health and well-being” is the goal that we selected to find a solution from the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. This goal aims to ensure health and well-being for all people at all life stages. When we are investigating the goal, we realized that young generations are not maintaining healthy lives due to their busy schedules. As a result of it we decided to develop a mobile application as a solution. Here we mainly focused on the main four functionalities. Many of people don’t know regarding the important of BMI. Through our mobile application anyone can easily find out their BMI range because of the auto calculating system. At present the most of people are spending a busy life. So the probability of missing their healthy lives and some important duties is high. Preventing this, we have included a system to plan their daily routine without any missing. Everyone wants to get a knowledge about how to enrol for a healthy life. Although they want some medical instructions form a professional doctor, they haven’t no time to meet a doctor. So we hope to publish instructions for all their requirements as articles. And also, we will provide a chance to contact the doctor and get more info. Drinking lack of water is also a major problem that is in the society. Because of the hectic life most of one are missing the amount of required water per day. For this problem we will introduce a water reminder system throughout the day.
